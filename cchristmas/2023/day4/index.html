    <p>Use a Time Crystal to travel between the past (purple timeline) and present (green timeline). Your actions in the past affect the present, but not the other way around.<br>
<br>
      If you collect a berry in the past, it's vanished in the future.<br>
      <br>
      If you collect a berry in the future, then get it in the past, the one you already got disappears from your total because it was never there for you to grab in the first place.<br>
