	<p>Stock photo stories is an experiment in sequential visual storytelling. It's based off of the game <a href="https://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/nancy/index.html">Five Card Nancy</a>, but tries to push it to a more abstract level. In this game, you build a 5 panel story by choosing from a collection of randomly selected stock photos. Is it too abstract to really be cohesive? Probably. I'd consider these comics as more of a starting point for your brain's imagination. After all, your brain projects the action between panels in any comic. This just takes it a little farther.</p>
